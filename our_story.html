        <h2>Charting a New Course in Livestock Farming: Sustainable Practices, Elevating Lives</h2>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EsxFRsG.jpg" alt="TBG Farms Livestock">
        <p>TBG Farms envisions a Liberia where every rural farmer holds the power to change their destiny through sustainable livestock farming. In a sector ripe for revolution, we stand as catalysts for change, delivering hope one farm at a time.</p>

        <p>Liberian smallholder pig farmers face considerable challenges, with 90% lacking access to improved breeds and 95% missing out on essential formulated feeds, leading to poor yields and growth. This, coupled with a widespread lack of modern farming knowledge, stymies productivity. TBG Farms is addressing these critical issues head-on, bringing in superior genetics and comprehensive nutrition to transform the landscape of Liberian livestock farming.</p>

        <p>TBG Farms is revolutionizing the Liberian piggery sector by supplying improved pig breeds like the Duroc, known for its resilience, health, and higher yield potential. Understanding the pivotal role genetics play in sustainable farming, we're committed to providing smallholder farmers with affordable access to these superior breeds, leveling the field for quality livestock production.</p>

        <p>TBG Farms crafts its feed with a focus on sustainable and local sourcing, featuring cassava meal as a primary energy source. We enrich this with other locally available ingredients, ensuring a well-rounded diet that supports the health and growth of our pigs. Our commitment to using cassava underscores our dedication to boosting the local economy and reducing our environmental impact.</p>

        <p>TBG Farms not only delivers specialized pig feeds but also champions the full utilization of by-products. We convert manure and IMO by-products from our breeding facilities into rich organic compost. This nutrient-packed fertilizer is then supplied to local cash crop farmers, enhancing soil fertility and crop yields. Our initiatives are designed to foster a more sustainable and productive agricultural ecosystem, reflecting our dedication to innovation and community support.</p>

        <p>TBG Farms embarked on its mission in 2022 with a clear objective: to establish a model of sustainable agriculture that not only produces premium quality products but also boosts incomes and generates jobs in Liberia. In our first year, we've engaged over 50 smallholder pig farmers in Grand Bassa County and have established a network of 200 farmers nationwide.</p>

        <p>We're proud to lay the foundations for a future where our contributions significantly elevate the standard of living for our partners. It is both a privilege and a responsibility to offer products that not only meet the high standards of our customers but also improve the livelihoods of the hardworking farmers within our community.</p>
